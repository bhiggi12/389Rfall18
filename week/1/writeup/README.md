### Part 2 (75 pts)

Since my job was to audit the ECU's firmware for security, it is my responsibility to notify my boss of the conclusion I reached that the current ECU firmware has several complex security problems which, if made public, could be exploited to both damage the car and endanger its occupants.  In notifying my boss of these complex security problems, I would inform them it would take an estimated six months and a team of twenty developers to fix the problems I identified.

If the ECU's firmware has already been released, I would recommend for the company to either recall the vehicles that might be affected given that harm to the owner of the vehicle could result from an exploitation of the vulnerabilities.

If the ECU's firmware has not released, I would recommend for the company to postpone the release until the complex security problems have been resolved.

If the company is not willing to postpone the release, I would probably refrain from taking the information outside the company and continue through other outlets within the company to hopefully get the issue resolved.  The company could choose to fix the problems over the next six months and dedicate a team of twenty developers to the task and provide security patches to the firmware as each of the security issues is resolved.  This is not ideal, but would allow the company to not lose money from having the ECU's firmware not ready for release.

Another reason I would refrain from releasing this information outside the company is given that the information identifies vulnerabilities within the firmware, it could lead to exploitation attempts that could lead to damage to the car and endangering its occupants.  If a vulnerability is know, it would be easy for someone skilled to figure out a way to exploit it.  Thinking back to 2015, a vulnerability was found in the 2014 Jeep Cherokee which allowed for control of the vehicle to be taken remotely (Source: ['Remote Exploitation of an Unaltered Passenger Vehicle' by Valasek and Miller](https://ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Remote_Car_Hacking.pdf)).  The company, Chrysler, issued a recall for vehicles that might be suseptible to this hack, specifically those with the Chrysler Uconnect Dashboard (Source: [After Jeep Hack, Chrysler Recalls 1.4M Vehicles for Bug Fix](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/jeep-hack-chrysler-recalls-1-4m-vehicles-bug-fix/)).  Since the complex security problems are already known for the ECU’s firmware, it would be in the company’s best interest to address them before it gets released, to prevent someone from actually being harmed and having to go through the trouble of having to correct all affected ECUs out in the general population.

Even if I were to do nothing, any harm that would result from the complex security problems would be on the fault of the company.  One infamous case about a similar situation dates back to the early 1970s in which a number of cases relating to a defective product in the production of the Ford Pinto fuel system which lead to deaths of several drivers and passengers.  This case became a public relations and litigation issue for the car manufacturer.  The problem fell into the area of an ethical dilemma when an internal memo was released to an investigative journalist that proved that Ford knew of the decision and chose not to make changes before the cars were shipped.  More outrage stemmed from the information the cost per part/car was little more than eleven dollars.  By Ford choosing not to make the changes on the assembly line, they effectively made the proper business decision but, on a per case basis, made an ethically poor decision.  The result was a serious public relations nightmare leading to the eventual demise of the tainted Pinto line and costing Ford more money in litigation and negative perception than it would have cost for the upgrades to take place on the assembly line.  Clearly their cost-benefit analysis failed to account the proper variables.  (Sources: [Ford Pinto Case Study](http://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&Valuation/Papers/1999/Leggett-pinto.html); [Pinto Memo ‘It’s Cheaper Let Them Burn’](http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/autos/2008/oct/17/pinto-memo-its-cheaper-let-them-burn/).

Overall, I would do my job to inform the company management of the complex security problems present in the ECU’s firmware and provide my recommendations for addressing the issues.  I would refrain from releasing the information outside the company because it might lead to more harm than if the information was kept internal.  In this dilemma, the company has two options: to postpone the release address the issues (similar to Chrysler's response to 2014 Jeep Hack) or show disregard for the problem and focus more on the cost-benefit analysis (similar to the Ford Pinto).  I would provide the company with this information at which point the matter would be out of my hands.
