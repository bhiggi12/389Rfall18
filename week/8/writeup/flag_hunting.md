###### SECTION 6, ASCII (LENGTH: 991)   
The first recorded uses of steganography Can be traced back to 440 BC when Herodotus Mentions two exampleS in his Histories.[3] Histicaeus s3nt a message to his vassal, Arist8goras, by sha9ving the hRead of his most trusted servan-t, "marking" the message onto his scal{p, then sending him on his way once his hair had rePrown, withl the inastructIon, "WheN thou art come to Miletus, bid _Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon." Additionally, demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming attack to Greece by wrIting it dirfectly on the wooden backing oF a wax tablet before applying i_ts beeswax surFace. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusabLe writing surfAces, sometimes used for shorthand. In his work Polygraphiae Johannes Trithemius developed his so-called "Ave-Maria-Cipher" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. "Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Gotentissimi Creatoris" for example contains the concealed word VICIPEDIA.[4}
